# Product Badge

This extension adds developer-friendly, programmable badges to Magento.

## How it works

This extension adds a section into System > Configuration > Catalog > Product Badge Options that allows users to configure and create badges. A "Badge" product attribute is also added into the product configuration.

Each badge is created with a *label* and a *class* which allow the developer to style the badges differently on the frontend.
